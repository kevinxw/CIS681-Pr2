[Introduction]

Code Analyzer is actually a homework project from my class CIS681.  It is a simple software that analyzing code files.

I try very hard to make this a much more universal code analyzing software, which should not only work on C# files, but also other languages such as C++, JavaScript etc.  All you need to do is just add a grammar loader class, specific the language grammar, and override a couple of detector classes (if necessary).

[Project demands]

Code Analyzer is a program for quality analysis of C# code.  Its quality measures are limited to function size and cyclomatic complexity for each function in each file of a specified file set.  This tool will also analyze the distance between any two file sets using a metric based on cyclomatic complexity.

The purpose of this code analysis is to find functions that may need attention because of their size and/or complexity.  A secondary purpose is to help potential developer users get a quick understanding of the structure of a set of code.  The distance measure is intended to easily find where changes have been made to code during development and maintenance.
